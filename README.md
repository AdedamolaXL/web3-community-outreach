### SERVICE DELIVERY

#### Education
Education is a very important tool in creating a community around your outreach program because it gives you the opportunity to show people what your mission is all about and why they should be part of it. In our case, ArtCo is providing access to digital arts education to the general art community. We believe people have a natural thirst for self-improvement, and providing this particular service is our way of tapping into the art community. We want to bring together people who are passionate about learning, in one place where they can learn together. These student-members alongside more established artsits and educators who will assist in creating the curriculum and provide mentorship and guidance will form the crucial core of our membership in the beginning.

### SERVICES
* Education: 
  The education will be conducted as an online platform, where learning content in form of a curriculum is hosted; 
  The curriculum wil be in three phases for those interested in producing art for web3, promote their art in web3, preserving art in web3. Naturally the curriculum will teach topics at the intersection of art, technology and sustainability. Ideally we will welcome student-members of different levels of proficiency and allow flexbility for self-direction in choosing what they need to learn the most while guiding them to make the best choices. We will also focus more on digital art because of the virtual structure of the program and the philosophy behind it.
  
  * Produce art for web3: Those interested in producing art for web3 are in two broad categories: the newbies, the oldheads.. this demarcation is for those who are getting into art for the first time and those who just need to upskill or learn new techniques. We can create our curriculum around:
    * Digital Painting
    * Drawing
    * Vector Art
    * 3d modelling
    * 3D sculpting
    * Matte Painting and Photomanipulation
    * Pixel art
    * 2D animation
    * 3D animation
    
  * Promoting art in web3: This section of the curriculum will focus more on the 
    * marketing, 
    * netwroking, 
    * story-telling, 
    * branding side of things.
    
  * Preserving art in web3: This section will focus on how to use technology to preserve art, ethical and sustainability issues including a little bit of history
    * documentation
    * migration
    * emulation
    * recreation
    * ethical and sustainability issues
  
* Collaboration 
Collaboration is billed to run alongside the education stack but not restricted to the student-members, we recongize that our  membership has the potential to not only include artists only, but also art lovers in forms of techies, patrons, culturals institutions, etc. We want to create a open space where everyone can participate, collaborate and nurture each other's passions. We aim to caretake this through organizing virtual residency programs, exhibitions and competitions
  * virtual residency programs - specially created for student-members who have completed the program to have access to more resources, new cultures and techniques, an opportunity to work up with a sponsoring institution, polish and refine their art and figure out what they want to do after. It's a bit like an internship only that artist will be encouraged to expose themselves to new forms they haven't explored together. 
  * exhibitions - which is open to all members to exhibit, promote, showcase and curate their art. Exhibits will also serve as auctions, points-of-sales and a way to interface with sponsor institutions and companies. Non-members will be invited and allowed to participate in the experience though they may not participate themselves.
  * competitions which is open to both members and non-members is a free for all mode to encourage art innovation, there will be prizes up for grabs, and artists will be challenged to rethink and think outside the box in how they produce, promote and preserve their digital art, there is also the added bonus of marketing our DAO further and bringing in new members.

Synthetics can be applied to art auctions on chain, whereby listed art are betted against by holders that are not participants in the auction, all they simply need to do is bet on the price range at which the art will be sold, e.g:
Van Gogh’s letter is listed to be auctioned on Thursday.
Bets is placed on SEXP exchange using on-chain oracles.
A bets Pixie will be sold below 5000 XTZ.
B bets Pixie will be sold above 5000 XTZ.
If Pixie is sold above 5000 XTZ, A wins out and takes all.
Synthetics can also be applied to betting on the value of NFTs, in this case:
Poxie is listed on Kalamint with a current value of 100 XTZ.
A bets Poxie value will increase by 20%
B bets Poxie value will decrease by 20% 
They both send 100 XTZ into a smart contract
If the value does go up by 20% >> they split the difference in which A wins out.


* Cooperative Investments
Community members as patrons form an investment group (DA0). Investment pools is a way of bringing members resources to achieve the following goals:
  * jointly acquire artworks
  * sponsor specific projects
  * participate in the speeculative art market
  * invest profits from art-sales in liquidity pools designed to pay back members through automatic payouts.
because the web3 space is highly monetary-driven, we want a situation where our members are exposed to the nitty-gritty of the investment game, not just around NFTs but into the world of DEFI where the usecase before DAO resources can be better explored. We want to create a DAO in which NFT (ART) creators generally can pool their profits and invest in DEFI solutions and investment routes, serving as a solid passive-income/cash flow system for them.



* Loyalties Program
The loyalties program will be designed to reward members for their participation in community programmes. These does two things, it retains existing members and incentivize them to be more active in the community while also attracting prospective new members to the cause. Some popular incentives that can be applied to the art community include:
  * advance notice of/early access to new products
  * early access to sales
  * free merchandise or enhanced services
  * special services, like free or expedited shipping
  * members-only discounts
  * The loyalty program also forms basis to the DAO governance

 
There are various ways of utilizing a reward system in a decentralized way. Ideally the reward system will be connected to the wallet address of members.
Loyalty points will be equated to token value. Token value can be interchangeable and traded on-chain. Loyalty tokens may also be useful outside the community if the there are partnerships with other DAOs

Blockchains can also protect members privacy while making use of their data if they decided to make it available.

Blockchains can store and track loyalty points in real time via the use of smart contracts

the scope of how to reward our most loyal and active members may be explored not just in the governance edge of things but also in the acquistion side of art objects (through discounts) as well slash-prices for online/offline events. This is done to show value for members participations. Value for value is the name of the game.

Some systems to adopt are:
  * Points system - based on rate of purchases - discounts/bonuses and free NFTs
  * Tiered rewards - based on community participation - exclusives, whitelists
  (Points system x Tiered system) - governance 
  * Upfront patron fee - to protect and preserve a piece of art of their own choice, lower transaction fees?
  * Distinctive rewards - free tickets, early access, contact with their fav artiste, contribute to important socio-political causes
  * Partner with other communities, DAOs, cultural institutions
  * 
 On Chain message system for contacting NFT/Ticket holders

## 3. Target Market
   - Art lovers within the millenial demographic
  - Why? We are focussing on art lovers within the millenial demographic because they are the most tech-savvy and finally buoyant of the group considered. Gen Z is tech savvy as well but hasn't averagely hasn't achieved purchasing power as a demographic due to their age, while baby boomers while finally bouyant are not neccesarily tech-savy enough to probably handle web3 technologies. While we aim to be as open as possible and onboard as many people as possible. We have chose the millenial group as our focus group for the above reasons. But we welcome all people able to understand it.
  
  - How to encourage active participation?
Community building, participation and relationship is they key here.

  - What do we want want from the target group?
Their energy, passion, dedication, resources both mental, financial, social, etc.

  - What are we offering them?
A virtual community to explore the world of art with fellow art lovers.

  - Creating a safe, open accessible community for them..
No discrimination 

  - Incorporating the community members input in the community's vision

### Building Relationships

#### General Guidelines
  * To be seen, to be consistent, to be open, and deliver on our promises as an organization.
  * Include as many people, and organizations in our outreach to widen the net of communication and connections.
  * Treat everyone with respect and dignity befitting of stakeholders.
  * Nurture the principles of diversity, genuiness and sincerity within the community
  * Carry out extensive consultation with all stakeholders, before launching, and continue after launching on a consistent basis 

#### Building Relationships with Members
  * Validate the importance of each community member by involving them in goal-setting and governance of the community.
  * Keep an open line of communication and manage members expectation by clearly defining the goals and services being offered.
  * Clear the air on concerning issues within the community to reduce negative feelings and viewpoints.
  * Actively listen to community members, encourage inquiries and questions to figure out what members consider important.
  * Encourage diversity and encourage members to treat each other in a dignified, sincere manner.
 
#### Building Relationships with Partner Organizations
  * Research and reach out to:
    * organizations with similar missions, purposes, values
    * organizations with different missions, purposes, values but may have a similar vision, rationale, and objectives to explore potential partnerships with us
    * important community leaders and influencers
  * Look for common links, allies, connections and use them as a basis to bond
  * Attend events, webinars, workshops and use it as an opportunity to bond
  * Engage potential partners in important conversations like:
    * what you each do and ideas for what you each need;
    * ways you can benefit one another;
    * the communities and networks both organizations reach;
    * the strengths you can each offer with regard to a potential partnership;
    * cultural competence and communication styles.
  * Create a statement clearly outlining the partnership’s vision, rationale, and objectives. Also, explain why you are partnering. Be explicit about each partner’s role and assign tasks and responsibilities based on strengths. Begin with smaller tasks and responsibilities, and then increase their size and complexity over time.
  * Establish metrics to track desired activities, outputs, and outcomes (e.g., logic models or fidelity scales). Share relevant data as much as possible.
 
 #### Specific Strategies 
  * Conduct a needs assessment to understand what the (digital) art communitites require the most and focus on that in terms of design for the DAO
    * Collect accurate data, stories, case-studies to get the perfect picture of the reality on ground.
    * Identify the most important issues raised and the most important features needed and implement based on that
    * Let the marketing outreach focus on telling stories
    * Minimize assessment or intake procedures to lessen the bottlenecks for incoming members
   
 Centralization vs Decentralization
 Transperancy vs Secrecy
 Acquistion vs Speculative
 
## TEZOS

### DEFI Solutions for Art Communites and Cultural Institutions

#### Tokenization
     *  Fungible tokens - may be applied to loyalty programs in form of a point-based systems based on rate of purchases, the point value is equated to the token value, i.e if a user has accumulated 100points, they then have 100T. The points-system will be measured in real time and stored on chain. The value will be attached to the user wallet address which will be visible in their wallet using an on-chain messaging system which users can then use to buy new artworks.
     *  Non-fungible tokens - in addition to the normal trading function of NFTs, NFTs may be used in loyalty program to reward community members by offering free-tickets
     * Non-transferable tokens - will be applied to the online learning platform, where student-members who have completed can receive NTTs as badges of completion which can be useful in the outside world as proof of knowledge. Student-members can even use this badges to apply for residency programs sponsored by cultural institutions. NTTs will also be awarded to those who participate in exhibitions and competitions.
     * Mutli-asset contracts - 
     * Fractionalized NFTs - is useful for the joint-ownership of artworks by members.
     * Asset-backed tokens - this is an experimental feature, to see the possibilities of basing the value of tradeable tokens created by the community on the value of artworks they have - generally it's advised that artworks in this case be of museum-standard with higher intrinsic value.
