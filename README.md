> We are ArtCo, bridging the gap between art's, past, present and future. 
> The past in form of created Art, the present in form of the viewer or new owner and the future in form of the decentralization of the cultural heritage of the world. 



## 2. Outlining the Goal

### AIM
Our primary goal is to create a community outreach program styled as DAO which brings art lovers in close contact and communion with cultural instutions with the purpose of preserving and promoting art while fostering key ethos like collaboration, decentralization, education.

### SERVICES
* Education: Education is a very important tool in creating a community around the outreach program because you want people to learn about what you are doing and why they should be part of it. In our case we are trying to educate and promote art among our community members, not just existing one but prospective ones. This is very important because generally people are always excited about learning about something they are passionate about. What we want to do is here then is to bring these people together, to learn together in one place.
  The education will be conducted as an online platform, where learning content in form of a curriculum is hosted; 
  The curriculum wil be in three phases for those interested in producing art for web3, promote their art in web3, preserving art in web3. Naturally the curriculum will teach topics at the intersection of art, technology and sustainability. Ideally we will welcome student-members of different levels of proficiency and allow flexbility for self-direction in choosing what they need to learn the most while guiding them to make the best choices. We will also focus more on digital art because of the virtual structure of the program and the philosophy behind it.
  
  * Produce art for web3: Those interested in producing art for web3 are in two broad categories: the newbies, the oldheads.. this demarcation is for those who are getting into art for the first time and those who just need to upskill or learn new techniques. We can create our curriculum around:
    * Digital Painting
    * Drawing
    * Vector Art
    * 3d modelling
    * 3D sculpting
    * Matte Painting and Photomanipulation
    * Pixel art
    * 2D animation
    * 3D animation
    
  * Promoting art in web3: This section of the curriculum will focus more on the 
    * marketing, 
    * netwroking, 
    * story-telling, 
    * branding side of things.
    
  * Preserving art in web3: This section will focus on how to use technology to preserve art, ethical and sustainability issues including a little bit of history
    * documentation
    * migration
    * emulation
    * recreation
    * ethical and sustainability issues
  
* Collaboration 
Collaboration is billed to run alongside the education stack but not restricted to the student-members, we recongize that our  membership has the potential to not only include artists only, but also art lovers in forms of techies, patrons, culturals institutions, etc. We want to create a open space where everyone can participate, collaborate and nurture each other's passions. We aim to caretake this through organizing virtual residency programs, exhibitions and competitions
  * virtual residency programs - specially created for student-members who have completed the program to have access to more resources, new cultures and techniques, an opportunity to work up with a sponsoring institution, polish and refine their art and figure out what they want to do after. It's a bit like an internship only that artist will be encouraged to expose themselves to new forms they haven't explored together. 
  * exhibitions - which is open to all members to exhibit, promote, showcase and curate their art. Exhibits will also serve as auctions, points-of-sales and a way to interface with sponsor institutions and companies. Non-members will be invited and allowed to participate in the experience though they may not participate themselves.
  * competitions which is open to both members and non-members is a free for all mode to encourage art innovation, there will be prizes up for grabs, and artists will be challenged to rethink and think outside the box in how they produce, promote and preserve their digital art, there is also the added bonus of marketing our DAO further and bringing in new members.

* Cooperative Investments
Community members as patrons form an investment group (DA0). Investment pools is a way of bringing members resources to achieve the following goals:
  * jointly acquire artworks
  * sponsor specific projects
  * participate in the speeculative art market
  * invest profits from art-sales in liquidity pools designed to pay back members through automatic payouts.
because the web3 space is highly monetary-driven, we want a situation where our members are exposed to the nitty-gritty of the investment game, not just around NFTs but into the world of DEFI where the usecase before DAO resources can be better explored. We want to create a DAO in which NFT (ART) creators generally can pool their profits and invest in DEFI solutions and investment routes, serving as a solid passive-income/cash flow system for them.



* Loyalties Program
The loyalties program will be designed to reward members for their participation in community programmes. These does two things, it retains existing members and incentivize them to be more active in the community while also attracting prospective new members to the cause. Some popular incentives that can be applied to the art community include:
  * advance notice of/early access to new products
  * early access to sales
  * free merchandise or enhanced services
  * special services, like free or expedited shipping
  * members-only discounts
  * The loyalty program also forms basis to the DAO governance

 
There are various ways of utilizing a reward system in a decentralized way. Ideally the reward system will be connected to the wallet address of members.
Loyalty points will be equated to token value. Token value can be interchangeable and traded on-chain. Loyalty tokens may also be useful outside the community if the there are partnerships with other DAOs

Blockchains can also protect members privacy while making use of their data if they decided to make it available.

Blockchains can store and track loyalty points in real time via the use of smart contracts

the scope of how to reward our most loyal and active members may be explored not just in the governance edge of things but also in the acquistion side of art objects (through discounts) as well slash-prices for online/offline events. This is done to show value for members participations. Value for value is the name of the game.

Some systems to adopt are:
  * Points system - based on rate of purchases - discounts/bonuses and free NFTs
  * Tiered rewards - based on community participation - exclusives, whitelists
  (Points system x Tiered system) - governance 
  * Upfront patron fee - to protect and preserve a piece of art of their own choice, lower transaction fees?
  * Distinctive rewards - free tickets, early access, contact with their fav artiste, contribute to important socio-political causes
  * Partner with other communities, DAOs, cultural institutions
  * On Chain message system for contacting NFT/Ticket holders

## 3. Target Market
   - Art lovers within the millenial demographic
  - Why? We are focussing on art lovers within the millenial demographic because they are the most tech-savvy and finally buoyant of the group considered. Gen Z is tech savvy as well but hasn't averagely hasn't achieved purchasing power as a demographic due to their age, while baby boomers while finally bouyant are not neccesarily tech-savy enough to probably handle web3 technologies. While we aim to be as open as possible and onboard as many people as possible. We have chose the millenial group as our focus group for the above reasons. But we welcome all people able to understand it.
  
  - How to encourage active participation?
Community building, participation and relationship is they key here.

  - What do we want want from the target group?
Their energy, passion, dedication, resources both mental, financial, social, etc.

  - What are we offering them?
A virtual community to explore the world of art with fellow art lovers.

  - Creating a safe, open accessible community for them..
No discrimination 

  - Incorporating the community members input in the community's vision
  

## 5. Budget

The starting budged from Institution will be invested in different Defi-Routes and from the yield of this,
new pools are created by the Dao. In these pools every member can contribute and earn some part of the yield. 

The DAO gets completly financed by the returns from these liquidity pools, but never invests more than 2-5% to each position,
so that no dramatic fail-event like the Luna-crisis can compromise the liquidity of the DAO. 
Up to 30% of the initial budged can be distributed to non-defi investments like new Art Originals,
but also Gold, Silver, Platinum, Tantal and other rare & expensive materials as a security for the DAO.

The first pools yield money will create new pools -  the DAO can vote for or against the new pools.
From these new pools yield the DAO will create again new pools. 
Every yield return will be splitted for new pools, running costs & new projects. 

In this way the Dao can create a stable financial position.  

After creating some pools & new pools from the yield, the DAO creates a DAO (index) coin of its investments & owned Art.

And a second coin - the ARTCO DAO COIN will be minted by new Artists each time they sell ART or create Art in the DAO. 

This ARTCO Coin represents the DAO and is used by DAO members to use the voting rights on new proposals. 


## 6. Obstacles/Competitions
We need some starting budged to create some pools and create the DAO itself, then we need to find institutions to join the DAO 
and then invest money & time & arts to the DAO.
